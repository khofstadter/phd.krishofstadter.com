## Developing brain-computer music interfaces for meditation
by Krisztián Hofsädter

A thesis in partial fulfilment of the requirements of Anglia Ruskin University, Faculty of Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences, for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy.

The thesis was submitted in 2021 to the Cambridge School of Creative Industries and accepted in 2022.

The original PDF accepted can be found at [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Krisztian-Hofstaedter).

I am gradually reformating the thesis so it can be used as a website. It's finished up to chapter 1.
